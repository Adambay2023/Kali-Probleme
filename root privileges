sudo su
su: failed to execute zsh: No such file or directory

Solve the problem of logging in with root privileges using the sudo su command
The first thing you must open the terminal again and type sudo apt install update && install upgrade
If the problem is not resolved, type sudo nano /etc/passwd. 
Attention, you must type sudo in order to be able to save the modifications
Search for root:x:0:0:root:/root: it will look like root:x:0:0:root:/root:zsh or root:x:0:0:root:/root:/usr/ bin/zsh 
change them to root:x:0:0:root:/root:/usr/bin/bash
Press ctrl+o, then enter, then ctrl+x, and reopen the terminal
Congratulations, your problem has been solved
